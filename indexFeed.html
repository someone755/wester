<h1>A Holiday For Everyone</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Wester is a tradition started by two goofballs in 2016. It celebrates waffles, friendship, love, and more waffles. It is celebrated every year on the Friday after Nutella day; This is why waffles with Nutella are especially encouraged. In 2016 the holiday was on February 12th, and February 10th in 2017. The 2018 celebration is scheduled for February 9th.</p>

<h1>The Story</h1>
<p class="paragraph">In late 2015, two friends debated religion and the Easter holiday. Coming to a conclusion that their beliefs could not ever come between them, they had an idea: A holiday that everybody could celebrate, regardless of their nationality, religion, health, or other human trait.</p>
<p>In German, the Wester holiday, translated as 'Waffelaufstand', is a transformation of the German word for 'armed uprising' into something waffle-relatedâ€”something no one man could hate. As a parallel to Easter, the rough translation of 'Waffelaufstand' into English is "resurrection of the waffle," yet another nod to the newfound peace- and friendship-inspiring tradition.</p>
